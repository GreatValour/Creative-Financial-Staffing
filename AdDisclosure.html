                      This site offers a free, for-profit, advertiser-supported
                      financial comparison and marketing service. When you submit the
                      form on this site, we send your information to lenders and
                      third-party lender networks that are not lenders to try to connect
                      you with a lender. We and our network partners may also share your
                      contact information with other third-party marketing partners that
                      may offer you other credit-related products or services (eg. debt
                      relief, credit repair or credit monitoring).&nbsp;
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      We receive financial compensation from these various partners in
                      exchange for connecting you with them, sharing your information
                      with them and/or marketing their products and services to you.
                      This compensation allows us to offer our service for free to you
                      and make a financial profit. This compensation may impact which
                      providers you are connected with and the placement of ads. You are
                      likely to be connected with the highest bidder(s) or see ads for
                      the highest bidder(s).&nbsp;

                    <h4>
                      <strong
                        >We first share your information with the lenders in our
                        network</strong

                    <p>
                      When you submit a form on this site, our proprietary loan
                      marketplace processes this information to determine which lenders
                      in our network have expressed interest in offering a loan to
                      consumers like you. We then share all of your information with
                      these lenders so they can decide whether and how much they are
                      willing to pay us to be connected with you. If only one lender is
                      willing to pay us to be connected to you, we connect you with that
                      lender. If more than one lender is willing to pay us to be
                      connected with you, our proprietary algorithm uses a number of
                      variables to determine which lender to connect you with. However,
                      the amount the lender is willing to pay us is likely to be the
                      most important variable impacting which lender we connect you
                      with.&nbsp;
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      We do not exercise any control over any lenders and we do not
                      endorse any specific lender.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      Most users that are connected with a lender using our service are
                      connected to lenders in our extended network, and not with lenders
                      in our direct network. (Keep reading to learn more about our
                      extended network).

                      <strong
                        >We will likely share your information with non-lender
                        third-party lender networks</strong

                    </h4>
        
                    <p>
                      If none of the lenders in our network are willing to pay us to be
                      connected with you, we then share your information with our
                      extended network of non-lender third-party lender networks
                      (“Lender Networks”) to see if any of the lenders in their networks
                      are willing to pay us to be connected with you. These Lender
                      Networks are loan marketing companies that are commonly referred
                      to as “lead aggregators.”
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      These Lender Networks show your information to the lenders in
                      their network to see if any are willing to pay them (and,
                      indirectly, us) to be connected with you. If only one Lender
                      Network has a lender that is willing to pay to be connected with
                      you, we and the Lender Network connect you with that lender. If
                      more than one Lender Network has a lender in their network that
                      wants to pay to be connected with you, our proprietary algorithm
                      uses a number of variables to determine which Lender Network we
                      will use to connect you with the relevant lender in that network.
                      However, the amount the Lender Network is willing to pay us is
                      likely to be the most important variable impacting which Lender
                      Network’s lender we choose to connect you with.&nbsp;
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      Our Lender Networks do not share the identities of their lenders
                      with us, and so we do not know which lender you are connected with
                      if you are connected through a Lender Network. We also do not know
                      which lenders in their network they show your information
                      to.&nbsp;
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                      We utilize Lender Networks both because they increase the
                      likelihood our users will be connected with a lender, and because
                      they help us make a financial profit from our free-to-consumer
                      service.

                      Many of our lenders and Lender Networks (together “Lending
                      Partners”) use service providers to manage their online consumer
                      acquisition, facilitate their purchasing of internet traffic from
                      websites like ours, verify your identity and information, look up
                      your credit history, or for other reasons related to your loan
                      request. These service providers may receive and process your data
                      on behalf of the Lending Partners they work for. In some cases, we
                      receive compensation from these service providers and not from the
                      lender directly.

                      for. If we are able to connect you with a lender, their identity
                      will only be disclosed to you after you have submitted our form.
                      We may redirect you to their site to see more about their loans.
                      They may reach out to you directly by phone, SMS and/or email. You
                      can review their offers and decide whether to take out a loan with
                      them. We highly recommend you compare multiple lenders and offers
                      so you can make an informed decision about your loan.&nbsp;

                      products or services, such as debt relief, credit repair or credit

                      that you submitted a form on this site and so may know what type
                      of loan you were interested in obtaining or whether you were

                      show you these ads both because we think our users may benefit
                      from the advertised products or services and because it helps us

                      service. We may send you ads or offers for loans and/or other
                      credit-related products or services by email, SMS, phone, postal
                      mail or other methods. We often utilize third-party advertising
                      service providers to conduct this advertising on our behalf. These
                      service providers will receive and process your contact
                      information that’s reasonably necessary to send you ads. They do
                      not receive any of the other information you submit on our form.
                      These service providers may also use their own technical service
                      providers to facilitate the delivery of ads to you, which may
                      necessitate your contact information being shared with these
                      additional service providers.&nbsp;

                      We are compensated by these advertisers. How much they pay us
                      impacts which advertiser’s products or services we advertise to
                      you. We advertise these products and services to you both because
                      we think our users may benefit from the advertised products or
                      services and because it helps us make a profit from our
                      free-to-consumer service.
